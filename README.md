# vim-topiary

[vim-topiary] trims excess whitespace from buffers on save. Three types of
whitespace are removed:

* trailing spaces and tabs at the end of lines
* blank lines at the start of the buffer
* blank lines at the end of the buffer

Additionally, multiple consecutive blank lines are collapsed to a single blank
line.

## Installation

To install vim-topiary using [vim-plug], add the following to your vimrc
(`$HOME/.vim/vimrc` for Vim and
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nvim/init.vim` for Neovim), restart Vim, and
run `:PlugInstall`:

```viml
Plug 'srstevenson/vim-topiary'
```

Using [Dein.vim], add the following to your vimrc file, restart Vim, and run
`:call dein#install()`:

```viml
call dein#add('srstevenson/vim-topiary')
```

Using [Vundle], add the following to your vimrc file, restart Vim, and run
`:PluginInstall`:

```viml
Plugin 'srstevenson/vim-topiary'
```

## Configuration

To disable vim-topiary for specific filetypes, set `g:topiary_ft_disabled` in
your vimrc file to a list of filetypes. By default vim-topiary is disabled in
diff buffers:

```viml
let g:topiary_ft_disabled = ['diff']
```

You may not want to collapse multiple blank lines in all filetypes. For example
in Python top-level function and class definitions should be surrounded with
two blank lines. In this case only three or more consecutive blank lines should
be collapsed, and to two blank lines rather than one. You can specify this
behaviour for specific filetypes by setting
`g:topiary_ft_allow_two_blank_lines` in your vimrc to a list of filetypes. By
default this is enabled in Python buffers:

```viml
let g:topiary_ft_allow_two_blank_lines = ['python']
```
